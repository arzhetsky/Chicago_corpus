# Chicago_corpus
A collection of data files associated with biomedical texts

This study contributes six components to an advanced, named-entity analysis tool for biomedicine: (a) a new, Named-Entity Recognition Ontology (NERO) developed specifically for describing entities in biomedical texts, which accounts for diverse levels of ambiguity, bridging the scientific sublanguages of molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, and medicine; (b) detailed guidelines for human experts annotating hundreds of named-entity classes; (c) pictographs for all named entities, to simplify the burden of annotation for curators; (d) an original, annotated corpus comprising 35,865 sentences, which encapsulate 190,679 named entities and 43,438 events connecting two or more entities; (e) validated, off-the-shelf, named-entity recognition automated extraction, and; (f) embedding models that demonstrate the promise of biomedical associations embedded within this corpus.
